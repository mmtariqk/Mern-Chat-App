# Interactive MERN Chat App

## App Name
Real-time Chat Application

## Application Summary

Gamma can help drive productivity, Return on Investment (ROI) and efficiency in every industry in this era of digitalization. Creating a chat application is always an interesting thing to do. And it is a good way to learn a lot because you are creating some interactions with your application. In-app chat typically means private, bidirectional chat and direct messaging between or more people within a software application. So, I have created a real-time chat app that is powered by Socket.IO and Mern Stack. This is a web application that allows multiple users to have a private and public chat. This app allows one to one chat online and its fast and easy to use, because it's very user friendly. 


#### Chat Delivers on the Need for Direct Communication
Designers are leading the charge on how people are connecting and building relationships with the internet, providing a new layer of communication and decision making through smart chat app design. I hope to showcase a few in-app messaging examples from real companies that are solving real problems.

## Technologies & Tools Used:

HTML | CSS | JavaScript | React | Apollo - client MongoDB and Mongoose | Express | 
Node.js | socket.io | socket.io - client | Apollo server express | GraphQL | 
JWT (JSON Web Token) | bcrypt | dotenv | Heroku  

## Design Consideration

## Use Cases - Ref 

Case Study: Thumbtack In-App Chat
I’m going to speculate that Thumbtacks massive growth is related to two prime things they did incredibly well with their user experience. First, they designed a fantastic onboarding experience, and they leveraged chat in their application as the central communication system. I think this makes them have one of the best in application chat designs.

## Acceptance Criteria - Chat App Gamma

1.	As a Business Owner, I want to see a list of my contacts who are available on Gamma (Chat App) so that I can start chatting one-on-one with anyone of them. I should also be able to search for a contact from a friend list.

2.	As Business Owner, I want to see a list of all my chat threads in one place so that I can quickly resume with my previous chats.
